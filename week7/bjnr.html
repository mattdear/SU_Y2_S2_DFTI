see pictures of some of the things I see here. Check this out: a badger seen
in broad daylight!</p>

<!-- This is a malicious invisible "image" which sends a request to 
    download.php on HitTastic! If the user is logged into HitTastic, a
    song will be downloaded, and funds deducted, without their knowledge!
    The 'alt' tag makes it look like it's just a label for the badger image
    above. -->
