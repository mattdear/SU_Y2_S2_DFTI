## Week 2
- Question 1ii – The file did not work because the artist was sent with the name theArtist and we were looking for name. So, I changed the input name to name. The form also did not call the searchresults.php file as the action so, I updated the code to do this.

###### Week Summery
We looked at how to connect to a database using the PDO command. We also looked at how to run SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE commands using PHP. I managed to complete all tasks in the list this week and feel that as I have done databases before I did not learn to much.
